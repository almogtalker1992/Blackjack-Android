# Blackjack-Android
A simple blackjack game application for android.

This application for android users created by me a while back before I started my BS.c in CS.

It includes 3 simple core OOP classes written in Java (Card, Hand, Deck) which represent Card, Deck and Hand structures (Can be used for other card games..).

There is a main class (MainActivity.java) which controls the blackjack flow logic.
Also there are some activities required for appearence.

# How To Play?
Download apk file and use external apk installation option on your phone settings ("Developer Mode").
